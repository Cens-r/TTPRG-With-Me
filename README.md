# TTRPG-With-Me
Android App developed by my group for our Mobile App Development class.
Developed during the Fall 2023 semester.

## Summary
A TTRPG character maker, with the focus on being easy to setup and use.
Shareability of these characters and character sheets is another key aspect we'd like to achieve and prioritize.

For our app we've decided on Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) character creator. This app will allow the user to create, store, and edit characters for their DnD games on the fly from their phones. We'll also have the potential to expand this system to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate encounters or come up with creative items for these characters. Ultimately this app should ease the beginning stages of a DnD campaign, getting to the action faster by reducing the amount of time it takes to create a character. We've also tossed around the idea of adding some sort of game map that the players and DM can use, we'd like to add this to connect the players and keep things organized while doing a game. However, this is prioritized lower and we're not sure if we'll be able to accomplish it within the timeframe of the project. Persistent storage will be used in this app to store the characters and item/encounter info for the user, so it can be accessed anytime the app is opened. Web Services will be used to contact the LLM and possibly web scraping DnD wiki's to populate item info and stats.
